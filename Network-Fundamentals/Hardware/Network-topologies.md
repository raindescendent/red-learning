***Hardware, type and topology***

**Types**
- LAN (Local Area Network)
-     Can connect to other external devices or networks using Bridges, Routers and Gateways. 
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
- WAN (Wide Area Network)

**Topologys**

- *Bus*: A cable with a terminator at each end from which they "hang" all elements of a network. 
-    Advantages: Easy to connect the new node. Require less cable 
-    Disadvantages: It's all depends on the main cable. If it gets break, the entire network is off. Require signal terminators. In a big building is a problem if is the only one solution for networking.
- *Star*: All and each of the nodes of the network connects to a hub.  
-    Advantages: Easy to install, avoids failures and also facilitates maintenance of the nodes/devices.
-    Disadvantages: Requires more cable and hubs. If the hub fails isolates all nodes connected to it. 
- *Ring*: Each station connects to the next, and the last connects to the first at the end of the network. Additionally, each one has a *TOKEN* which is a signal receiver/transmitter for the previous/next node in that order.
- *Double Ring*: This topology allows data to be sent in both directions. Is although only one ring is used at a time. If one fails the other ring can transmit the data. 
- *Three*: Similar to a star topology, in this case some nodes are connected to the principal hub and other devices are linkeds to a secondary hub. 
- Mesh: Direct connections between devices, the links are PPP.
-    Partial Mesh
-    Full Mesh
